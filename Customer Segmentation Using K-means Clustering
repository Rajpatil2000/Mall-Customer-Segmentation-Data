Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering
##	Project Overview
#This project uses K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase history, specifically focusing on Annual Income and Spending Score. By identifying unique customer groups, this analysis enables targeted marketing strategies for improved customer engagement and profitability.
##	Project Structure
#	Data: Mall_Customers.csv - A dataset containing customer demographics and spending information.
#	Scripts: Python scripts that handle data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and visualization.
#	Results: Insights from the clustering analysis, including visualizations and cluster interpretation.
# Goals
•#The primary objective is to group customers into segments with similar purchasing behaviors. These insights can guide personalized marketing campaigns and customer engagement strategies.

•#Steps in the Analysis
#	Data Exploration and Preprocessing
•#Load and Inspect: Display the first few rows, check data types, and identify any missing values.
#Feature Selection: Focus on relevant features for clustering, such as Annual Income and Spending Score.
#Scaling: Normalize features to improve clustering performance.
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#Visualize Distributions: Analyze the distribution of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score to understand customer demographics.
#	Elbow Method: Use this method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia).
#	Clustering with K-means
#	K-means Algorithm: Perform clustering with the selected number of clusters.
#	Interpretation: Analyze each cluster to understand different customer segments based on income and spending.
#	Results and Visualization
#	Cluster Plot: A scatter plot of customers segmented by clusters to visualize purchasing patter
#	High Income, High Spending: Premium customers who may benefit from exclusive offers.
#High Income, Low Spending: Potential target for increased engagement.
#Low Income, High Spending: Younger or budget-conscious customers who enjoy discretionary spending.
 # conclusion
# #The K-means clustering model identified distinct customer groups that can guide marketing strategies. 
#This segmentation allows for targeted approaches, increasing customer engagement and driving profitability for the retail store.
